# Credit Risk Clustering and Classification

This repository is dedicated to a comprehensive analysis of credit risk assessment for loan applicants using a dataset that contains 1000 entries with various attributes. The goal of this project is to cluster customers and classify whether an applicant is considered a Good or a Bad credit risk.


## Task

The primary objective of this project is to perform credit risk assessment by following a series of implementation steps:

### Key Tasks

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
   - Explore the dataset and perform any necessary data cleaning.
   
2. **One-Hot Encoding:** 
   - Perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables to prepare them for analysis.
   
3. **Numerical Feature Visualization:** 
   - Visualize the histograms of numerical features.
   - Check for skewness in the data and apply log transformation if necessary.
   - Recheck the histograms to see if data has been normalized.

4. **Feature Scaling:** 
   - Apply feature scaling to ensure consistency in feature magnitudes.

5. **Clustering:**
   - Select only numerical features for clustering.
   - Apply the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters.
   - Choose the optimum number of clusters.

6. **PCA Visualization:**
   - Visualize the clusters using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

7. **Classification:**
   - Implement K-Fold Cross-Validation.
   - Use a classifier of your choice to predict credit risk.
   - Report evaluation metrics to assess classifier performance.
